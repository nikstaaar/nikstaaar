I am student at [neuefische](https://neue-fische.de/) trying to figure out web-development. I am getting better each day (hopefully)

When I am not mastering JavaScript I like to:

- 🐶 walk my dog Paula
- 🍸 mix cocktails
- 😎 hang out with friends
- ✈️ travel the world
- 👨‍🍳 cook delicious food
- ⛵ learn how to sail a boat
- 🏃 run
